# Image-processing-projects
This repository contain 3 Image Processing functions implementation in Matab:

1. visible_watermark function adds a visible watermark on top of another image, you could change the location
and the intesity.

2. lsbeatermark function hides an image inside the 3 lsb of another image-using bit wise operations without watermarking Matlab functions

3. checkiswatermark function check if a watermarked image has been manipulated

Each function contains detailed documentation, please feel free to make optimization suggestions
** To properly run the code, don't forget to change the image names to yours (in the imread operation)

Example of function 1 outputs:
